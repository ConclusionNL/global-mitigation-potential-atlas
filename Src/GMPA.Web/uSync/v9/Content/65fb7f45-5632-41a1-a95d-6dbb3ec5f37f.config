    <caseIntroduction>
      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Uruguay's power sector is dominated by renewables. In 2020, renewables accounted for 94% of generation, reaching up to 98%. Hydropower is a significant source of electricity, with wind power growing significantly over the past 15 years. Uruguay began renewable energy auctions in 2006 and has increased the renewable energy share of the electricity mix by 93% since signing the Kyoto Protocol. [1]</p>]]></Value>
