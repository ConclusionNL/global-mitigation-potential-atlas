      "keyObjectivestargets": "<p>\"The strategy states that the proliferation of renewable energy (RE) in Viet Nam should be done in accordance with socio-economic development needs. The RE Strategy will focus on \"\"proven\"\" technologies, such as wind, solar, biomass, biogas, and hydropower. The law will incentivize RE uptake through market mechanisms, such as devoting capital from all economic sectors towards RE, and improving RE technology competitiveness. The specific goals are as follows:<br>* Increase the total production and use of RE sources from approx. 25 million ton of oil equivalent in 2015 to 37 million TOE in 2020; approx. 62 million TOE in 2030 and 138 million TOE in 2050<br>* The RE share in total primary energy consumption in 2015 shall be approx. 31.8%; 31% in 2020; 32.3% in 2030 and 44% in 2050.<br>*Increase the total electricity production from RE sources from approx. 58 billion kWh in 2015 to 101 billion kWh in 2020, approx. 186 billion kWh in 2030 and 452 billion kWh in 2050. The share of RE-based electricity in the total national production shall rise from 35% in 2015 to 38% in 2020; 32% in 2030 and 43% in 2050.<br>* Increase the absorption area of solar water-heating units from approx. 3 million m^2 in 2015 to about 8 million m^2 in 2020; approx. 22 million m^2 in 2030 and approx. 41 million m^2 in 2050. *Increase the proportion of households with solar water-heating devices (solar water-heating panels, residential cooking hobs, air heating and cooling units, water distillation, etc.) from approx. 4.3% in 2015 to 12% in 2020, 26% in 2030 and 50% in 2050.<br>*Scale up the application of biogas technologies with a construction volume of from approx. 4 million m3 in 2015 to 8 million m^3 in 2020; approx. 60 million m^3 in 2030, and 100 million m^3<br>in 2050.<br>*Increase the production of biofuels from approx. 150 thousand TOE in 2015 to about<br>800 thousand TOE, , i.e. 5% of transport sector’s fuel demand in 2020; 3.7 million TOE, i.e.<br>13% of transport sector’s fuel demand in 2030; 10.5 million TOE, i.e. 25% of transport<br>sector’s fuel demand in 2050.\"</p>"
