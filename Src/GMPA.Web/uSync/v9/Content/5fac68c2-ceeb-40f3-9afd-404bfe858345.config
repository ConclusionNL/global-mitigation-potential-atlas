    <caseIntroduction>
      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Namibia's power sector has historically been dominated by hydropower generation. Hydro accounted for 95% of total generation in 2015. Since this time, here has been a significant increase in solar power generation, particularly from 2017. As of 2020, solar generation accounts for around 20% of Namibia's total power generation.</p>
<p>In terms of capacity, solar PV has increased from around 20 MW in 2015 to around 150 MW in 2020 (note that this includes both utility scale and rooftop solar PV). In comparison, hydro capacity has increased only slightly during this time, from 330 MW to 350 MW. Coal capacity has remained flat at 120 MW.</p>
<p>Access to electricity in Namibia stood at 55% in 2021, while access to clean cooking technologies stood at 47%. Both have only slightly increased in recent years suggesting insufficient progress on these sustainable development indicators.</p>
<p>Namibia has set a target of 70% renewable share in domestic power generation by 2030 in their National Renewable Energy Policy.</p>]]></Value>

      "instrumentsText": "<p>Commencing in April 2015, the interim Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff (REFIT) scheme was designed as a pilot programme to increase generation from non-hydro sources. REFIT tariffs were initially set at quite generous levels and targeted  solar PV, wind, and biomass projects of 500 kW to 5 MW capacity. The tariff prices were revised prior to projects being awarded partly because of price levels in a similar programme in neighbouring South Africa (the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme). Final feed-in tariffs ranged from USD0.078/kWh for onshore wind to USD0.099/kWh for solar PV. These were indexed to inflation.</p>\n<p>Initially, 27 projects were granted provisional licences by the Electricity Control Board in the period leading up to the launch of the feed-in tariff programme. However, these failed to advance to financial close in the absence of a structured procurement programme. These projects were all invited to participate in the REFIT Programme and were given six months to submit all required documents. Fourteen projects (totalling 70 MW) were selected on a “first come, first meeting the requirements” basis. They then had six months to achieve the power purchase agreement effective date with  Namibia's  national power utility and a further 12 months to reach the commercial operation date. The remaining independent power producers were placed on a waiting list. The REFIT process therefore effectively became a race to the finish line, which helps to explain the rapid development of these projects.</p>\n<p>In 2016, 14 REFIT projects (5 MW each), totalling 70 MW and more than US$123 million worth of private investment, reached financial close. All 14 REFIT projects reached their power purchase agreeement milestones and 13 reached commercial operation date by the required date.</p>",
