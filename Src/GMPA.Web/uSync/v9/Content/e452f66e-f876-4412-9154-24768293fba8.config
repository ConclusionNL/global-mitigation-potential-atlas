      <Value><![CDATA[<p>"Coal production in Spain reached a peak in 1984 at 40 Mt per annum.  As of 2018, coal production had fallen to 2.4 Mt per annum. </p>
<p>In 1984, around 54,000 people worked in coal mining. However, coal mining employment had already been in decline for over 20 years prior to the 1984 production peak. By 2018, employment had declined to about 1,200 people. </p>
<p>In terms of domestic energy supply, coal accounted for 21% of Spain's total primary energy supply in 1990. This fell to 3% by 2020. For the country's power supply, coal's share fell from 40% in 1990 to 2% in 2020."</p>]]></Value>
