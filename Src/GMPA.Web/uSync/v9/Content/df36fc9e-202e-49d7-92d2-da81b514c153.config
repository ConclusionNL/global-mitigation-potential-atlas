      <Value><![CDATA[<h3>What is mitigation potential?</h3>
<p>The concept of “mitigation potential” has been developed to assess the scale of GHG reductions that could be made, relative to emission baselines, for a given level of carbon price (expressed in cost per unit of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions avoided or reduced).<sup>1</sup> Mitigation potential is further differentiated in terms of “market potential” and “economic potential”.<br><br>‘<strong>Market potential</strong>’ indicates the amount of GHG mitigation that might be expected to occur under forecast market conditions, including policies and measures in place at the time. It is based on private unit costs and discount rates, as they appear in the base year and as they are expected to change in the absence of any additional policies and measures. In other words market potential is the conventional assessment of the mitigation potential at current market price, with all barriers, hidden costs, etc. in place. The baseline is usually<br>historical emissions or model projections, assuming zero social cost of carbon and no additional mitigation policies. However, if action is taken to improve the functioning of the markets, to reduce barriers and create opportunities (e.g. policies of market transformation to raise standards of energy efficiency via labelling), then mitigation potentials will become higher.<br><br>In order to bring in social costs, and to show clearly that this potential includes both market and non-market costs, ‘<strong>economic potential</strong>’ is defined as the potential for cost- effective GHG mitigation when non-market social costs and benefits are included with market costs and benefits in assessing the options for particular levels of carbon prices in US$/ tCO2 and US$/tCO2e (as affected by mitigation policies) and when using social discount rates instead of private ones. This includes externalities (i.e. non-market costs and benefits such as environmental co-benefits).<br><br>Note that estimates of economic potential do not normally assume that the underlying structure of consumer preferences has changed. This is the proper theoretical definition of the economic potential, however, as used in most studies, it is the amount of GHG mitigation that is cost-effective for a given carbon price, based on social cost pricing and discount rates (including energy savings but without most externalities) (IPCC, 2001,<br>Chapters 3, 8 and 9).<br><br>The ‘<strong>technical potential</strong>’ is the amount by which it is possible to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or improve energy efficiency by implementing a technology or practice that has already been demonstrated. There is no specific reference to costs here, only to ‘practical constraints’, although in some cases implicit economic considerations are taken into account.<br><br>Finally the ‘<strong>physical potential</strong>’ is the theoretical (thermodynamic) and sometimes, in practice, rather uncertain upper limit to mitigation, which also relies on the development of new technologies.</p>]]></Value>
